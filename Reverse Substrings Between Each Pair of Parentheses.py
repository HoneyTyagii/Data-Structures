# 1190. Reverse Substrings Between Each Pair of Parentheses

# Medium

# You are given a string s that consists of lower case English letters and brackets.

# Reverse the strings in each pair of matching parentheses, starting from the innermost one.

# Your result should not contain any brackets. 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "(abcd)"
# Output: "dcba"

# Example 2:

# Input: s = "(u(love)i)"
# Output: "iloveu"
# Explanation: The substring "love" is reversed first, then the whole string is reversed.

# Example 3:

# Input: s = "(ed(et(oc))el)"
# Output: "leetcode"
# Explanation: First, we reverse the substring "oc", then "etco", and finally, the whole string.
 
# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 2000
# s only contains lower case English characters and parentheses.
# It is guaranteed that all parentheses are balanced.
