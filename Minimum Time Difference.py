# 539. Minimum Time Difference

# Medium

# Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in "HH:MM" format, return the minimum minutes difference between any two time-points in the list. 

# Example 1:

# Input: timePoints = ["23:59","00:00"]
# Output: 1

# Example 2:

# Input: timePoints = ["00:00","23:59","00:00"]
# Output: 0 

# Constraints:

# 2 <= timePoints.length <= 2 * 104
# timePoints[i] is in the format "HH:MM".
