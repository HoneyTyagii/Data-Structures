# 1957. Delete Characters to Make Fancy String

# Easy

# A fancy string is a string where no three consecutive characters are equal.

# Given a string s, delete the minimum possible number of characters from s to make it fancy.

# Return the final string after the deletion. It can be shown that the answer will always be unique.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "leeetcode"
# Output: "leetcode"
# Explanation:
# Remove an 'e' from the first group of 'e's to create "leetcode".
# No three consecutive characters are equal, so return "leetcode".

# Example 2:

# Input: s = "aaabaaaa"
# Output: "aabaa"
# Explanation:
# Remove an 'a' from the first group of 'a's to create "aabaaaa".
# Remove two 'a's from the second group of 'a's to create "aabaa".
# No three consecutive characters are equal, so return "aabaa".

# Example 3:

# Input: s = "aab"
# Output: "aab"
# Explanation: No three consecutive characters are equal, so return "aab".

# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 105
# s consists only of lowercase English letters.

class Solution:
    def makeFancyString(self, s: str) -> str:
        ans = s[0]
        cnt = 1
        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            if s[i] == ans[-1]:
                cnt += 1
                if cnt < 3:
                    ans += s[i]
            else:
                cnt = 1
                ans += s[i]
        return ans
