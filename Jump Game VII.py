# 1871. Jump Game VII

# Medium

# You are given a 0-indexed binary string s and two integers minJump and maxJump. In the beginning, you are standing at index 0, which is equal to '0'. You can move from index i to index j if the following conditions are fulfilled:

# i + minJump <= j <= min(i + maxJump, s.length - 1), and
# s[j] == '0'.
# Return true if you can reach index s.length - 1 in s, or false otherwise.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "011010", minJump = 2, maxJump = 3
# Output: true
# Explanation:
# In the first step, move from index 0 to index 3. 
# In the second step, move from index 3 to index 5.
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "01101110", minJump = 2, maxJump = 3
# Output: false
 

# Constraints:

# 2 <= s.length <= 105
# s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
# s[0] == '0'
# 1 <= minJump <= maxJump < s.length

        for i in q:
            q += [j for j in range(max(i+m,k),min(i+M+1,n)) if s[j]=='0']
            k = i+M+1

        return q[-1]==n-1
