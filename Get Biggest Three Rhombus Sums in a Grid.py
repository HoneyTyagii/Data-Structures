# 1878. Get Biggest Three Rhombus Sums in a Grid

# Medium

# You are given an m x n integer matrix grid​​​.

# A rhombus sum is the sum of the elements that form the border of a regular rhombus shape in grid​​​. The rhombus must have the shape of a square rotated 45 degrees with each of the corners centered in a grid cell. Below is an image of four valid rhombus shapes with the corresponding colored cells that should be included in each rhombus sum:


# Note that the rhombus can have an area of 0, which is depicted by the purple rhombus in the bottom right corner.

# Return the biggest three distinct rhombus sums in the grid in descending order. If there are less than three distinct values, return all of them.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: grid = [[3,4,5,1,3],[3,3,4,2,3],[20,30,200,40,10],[1,5,5,4,1],[4,3,2,2,5]]
# Output: [228,216,211]
# Explanation: The rhombus shapes for the three biggest distinct rhombus sums are depicted above.
# - Blue: 20 + 3 + 200 + 5 = 228
# - Red: 200 + 2 + 10 + 4 = 216
# - Green: 5 + 200 + 4 + 2 = 211
# Example 2:


# Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
# Output: [20,9,8]
# Explanation: The rhombus shapes for the three biggest distinct rhombus sums are depicted above.
# - Blue: 4 + 2 + 6 + 8 = 20
# - Red: 9 (area 0 rhombus in the bottom right corner)
# - Green: 8 (area 0 rhombus in the bottom middle)
# Example 3:

# Input: grid = [[7,7,7]]
# Output: [7]
# Explanation: All three possible rhombus sums are the same, so return [7].
 

# Constraints:

# m == grid.length
# n == grid[i].length
# 1 <= m, n <= 50
# 1 <= grid[i][j] <= 105
